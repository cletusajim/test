Hello Ezra,
You made it to class today, Wednesday May 29, 2019

You need to create a Git repo on your local to be able to do these commands.
To have a git repo on your local, login to your GithHub account create a new repo and initialize a readme. Copy the web url for that repo.
Go to the desired location on your local and GitBash copy to that location

Open a GitBash terminal,
git clone {web url for the git repo}
cd {to the directory}
git status
(open and update the file from the file location)
git add {filename}
git status (shows fiels in red, which means not ready)
git commit -m "{add a message here}"
git status (shows fiels in green, which means ready)
git push (pushes the file to the github directory)
